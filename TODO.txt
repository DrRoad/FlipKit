TODO FOR ME:
* Make the site behave gracefully if some data's missing!  E.g. tags,
  labels.  Maybe concat tags 1 & 2 in python.
* Include an API key that's just OK for localhost
* Remove dependencies on 'WY 1234' format from JS files, only deal in
  imageID strings.  May need to pre-process my csv file so that the
  site code can be more generic.
* Maybe I should rewrite the url parser in parsimmon (or regex :( )
* Talk about zoom levels vs distance??
