It replaced another built in 1921. When Greyhound started operating from the new terminal in 1940, usage of inter-city buses and railroad trains was rapidly expanding. But after World War II, the availability of the personal automobile and commercial airlines caused increasingly large reductions in both operations; the deterioration of its neighborhood after the 1968 riots probably also had an effect on usage of the terminal. In 1976 the building was ""slip-covered"" with metal and cement siding to ""modernize"" its appearance. By 1987, Greyhound had moved its operation into its Trailways terminal north of Union Station. A new office building, at ""1100 New York Avenue"" incorporating the Greyhound Terminal (in its original configuration) was completed in 1991.

Until World War II, it was the center of social functions for the black elite of the city, a gathering place for such personalities as Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, Joe Louis and Thurgood Marshall. However, partly because of the end of segregation, financial difficulties forced the sale of the hotel, leading to conversion to an apartment house for low-income families, and eventual deterioration to such a degree that it was closed by the city in 1977. A fire in 1981 destroyed the roof and much of the interior. In 1992, the building was completely renovated, remodeling it into 35 apartments.

Schneider, the 12-story Cairo Hotel was the tallest building in Washington when completed in 1894. Its facade was based on a Louis Sullivan building in the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Although initially advertised as an apartment house, only a few units had kitchens -- with many of the tenants using the roof-top restaurant. It soon changed its operation to that of an hotel, undergoing some modernization in the 1930s and after World War II. Like other buildings in the inner city, the Cairo declied rapidly in the 1960s and closed in 1972. In 1973, under new ownership, the building was drastically redesigned by Arthur Cotton Moore and refurbished, again as an apartment house. In 1979 it was changed into a condominium. Much of the Cairo's lasting historical significance results from the strong public objections of neighbors during its construction -- of the possible adverse effect of its height. Although the City Commissioners decided it was too late to stop construction of the building, it enacted height limitations on future buildings -- 90 feet for privately-owned residential structures and 110 feet for commercial ones. Even though the limitations have been modified, the unique overall pleasing skyline of the city exists partly because of the reaction to the building of the controversial ""skyscraper"".

(Two other similar duplex houses were built in the 2400 and 2500 blocks, for his other sons.) Thomas earlier had married Martha Parke Custis, the granddaughter of Martha Washington. In 1798 and 1799, George Washington visited the Peter house, spending the night there on his last trip to the city, shortly before he died. Although four of Thomas Peter's children were born in the house at 2618 K Street, the family lived there only a few years. In 1803 the duplex became the first British Legation in Washington, when rented to Anthony Merry, its minister here; his Legation successors, Francis Jackson and David Erskine used the houses until 1809. The Peter family continued to lease their K Street houses until about 1860 when it sold them. Although in later years the duplex was divided into apartments for lower-income tenants, by the 1950s, they had been rehabilitated into again handsome structures -- among the few pre-1800 houses in Washington, outside of Georgetown. In the 1960s, the last of the Peter Houses was demolished during the widening of K Street and construction of its below-grade roadway through Foggy Bottom, and the addition of the Whitehurst Freeway connections. (After leaving their K Street home, the Peter family bought a large Georgetown property in the 3100 block of Q Street on which they built ""Tudor Place"", their 26-room mansion, designed by William Thornton.)",WY 2910.43,"Print, Photographic","3.0"" x 4.5""",b/w,"From the John P.

Realizing the importance of the information obtainable, especially to agricultural interests, the Congress authorized the establishment of the U. S. Weather Bureau, eventually assigning it to the Department of Agriculture. To house the operation, a large unoccupied private residence on the south side of the 2400 block of M Street NW was purchased in 1891. (Built in 1869, the house had been extensively changed in 1884 to become the Ferguson Mansion.) The new U. S. Weather Bureau remodeled the inside and added lower buildings around three sides for practical use, it's staff supervising activities dealing with weather forecasting, river and flood control, etc., telegraphing resulting information across the country. By 1940, the Weather Bureau had been transferred to the Department of Commerce. Later, needing more space and a modern building, the Bureau moved, and in the late 1960s, the building was demolished. Eventually, the site, vacant for many years, was occupied by an office building, and much later, a large upscale apartment building.

Once the largest and most famous Washington brewery, it began in the early 1870s in the 1200 block of 20th Street NW, expanding until 1892 when a major fire destroyed the main building -- resulting in the decision to build, at 2500 Water Street, the much larger, fireproof structure, which in time, had its own bottling building and, after 1914, ice plant. Closed -- except for the commercial ice plant -- during the Prohibition period, the brewery resumed operation in 1933, and continued in popularity, producing such labels as ""Old Georgetown""' and ""Senate"" -- until 1956 when the company was dissolved, primarily as a result of the more intense competition from the larger national breweries, but also because of the Government's intent to eventually appropriate and buy the property (which it did in 1961) for use by the highway approaches to the proposed Roosevelt Bridge and Inner Loop Expressway. For a time, it rented some of the buildings -- the gymnasium, e.g., to the Arena Stage Theatre, and the stables, to the Wax Museum. By 1966 all the buildings in the complex were demolished. Another landmark, the Kennedy Center, was built on a neighboring site in 1971. (See James Goode's ""Capital Losses"".)",WY 3043.44,"Print, Photographic","3.0"" x 4.5""",b/w,"From the John P.

In 1828 recent-President James Madison -- whose wife, Dolley, was Cutts' sister-in-law -- bought the house but lived in Montpelier, his Virginia estate, until he died in 1836. Dolley then lived in the Lafayette Square house for a short time, until 1839, returning to Montpelier. After that estate was sold in 1844, she moved back to Lafayette Square, living there until her death in 1849. Captain Charles Wilkes, commander of the first United States naval exploration of the Pacific Ocean (in 1838-42), bought the house in 1851, and made extensive changes -- including moving the entrance to the H Street side and adding the first-floor balcony. During the Civil War, Gen. George McClellan used the Wilkes House as his headquarters, visited by President Lincoln. In 1883, the heirs of Commander Wilkes sold the building to the Cosmos Club, which made additional alterations. Since 1893, the building's external configuration, although renovated, has changed little. After the federal government bought the building on 1940, the Cosmos Club leased it until 1952, before moving into the Townsend House at 2121 Massachusetts Avenue NW. Extensive interior alterations were made to the building by the Government during the occupancy (until 1958) by the National Science Foundation, and NASA (until 1964). As part of the 1962 Lafayette Square Renewal Plan, restoration of the Dolley Madison House was completed in 1968; the building later became part of the Federal Judiciary Center complex, and then used by the U.S. Court of Appeals..",WY 3136.45,"Print, Photographic","3.0"" x 4.5""",b/w,"From the John P.
