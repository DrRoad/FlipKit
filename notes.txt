Trying to get the panorama with the right date
I think the best we can do might be to ask for "CLOSEST" panorama rather than "BEST" - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#StreetViewPreference

I think you have to do slightly lower level js to use that, 

Oh no, there are ways to specify the exact pano id... have to find it in the url?
YES!

https://www.google.com/maps/@38.9803796,-77.0291561,3a,75y,140.86h,83.94t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sCElgvzaE8lod5sDDGrwMLw!2e0!5s20090701T000000!7i13312!8i6656

The pano ID is CElgvzaE8lod5sDDGrwMLw - it's prefixed "1s" for some reason.

AAwwwwww. The marker doesn't show up when you specify the panorama ID.  WTF.

OK, it works if you set the position FIRST and then add the Marker and then set the Pano ID.  Fine, be that way.
